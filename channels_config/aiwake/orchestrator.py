"""The Provocateur — composes directives and drives the debate loop.

Division of labour, strictly held:

* ``room.py`` knows *how* a turn is shaped (guardrails, broadcast, transcript).
* ``memory.py`` knows *what has been said*.
* ``orchestrator.py`` knows *what to say next*.

The escalation logic lives here and nowhere else. Each exchange the orchestrator
assembles a directive from three inputs — the ladder rung for this turn, the
memory brief of concepts the target has leaned on, and an explicit ban on the
questions already asked. When a generated question still comes back repetitive,
it is re-rolled once under a harsher directive rather than shipped.
