"""Dynamic memory — a JSON-backed lightweight RAG with no vector store.

Why not embeddings: a debate transcript is a few thousand tokens. A TF-IDF-ish
lexical score over extracted concepts retrieves just as well at this scale,
costs nothing, adds no dependency, and stays inspectable — you can open
``store/aiwake_memory.json`` and read exactly why the orchestrator asked what it
asked. Swap in embeddings by reimplementing :meth:`DebateMemory.recall`; nothing
else in the package touches the internals.

The memory does three jobs for the provocateur:

1. **Extract** salient concepts from the target's answers.
2. **Recall** the concepts most relevant to the current thread, so questions
   build on what was actually said.
3. **Refuse repetition** — every question asked is fingerprinted, and a new one
   that overlaps too heavily with a past one is rejected before it is spoken.
